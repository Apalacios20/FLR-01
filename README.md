# Crypto Exchange UI

I have a keen interest in cryptocurrencies and web3, which led me to develop the user interface of a crypto exchange inspired by Uphold. This project involved leveraging the CoinMarketCap API to provide accurate and real-time data feeds. I built the frontend using Flutter to ensure a responsive and seamless user experience. For the backend, I utilized Go to efficiently process the data feeds and manage the exchange operations.
